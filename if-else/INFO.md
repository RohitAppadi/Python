# IF_ELSE Statements in Python

`if-else` statements are mainly used to create a snippet where a condition must be met.  
They allow the program to execute certain code **only if a condition is True**, and another code if the condition is False.

The Technical term - `NESTED if-else`.
The main purpose of the `if-else` statement is to make desicions in the programs and `nested if-else` is used for multiple layering of conditions.
